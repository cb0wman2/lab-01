# Warm-up Exercises
### Q1. How many tourist attractions are there in the data set?

```{r}
nrow(visitors)
```

348

#### a. Create a frequency table of the number of tourist attractions in the data set by region

```{r}
visitors %>%
  count(region, sort = TRUE)
```

#### b. Create a frequency table by admission and setting

```{r}
visitors %>%
  count(admission, setting, sort = TRUE)
```

### Q2. What are the variable data types?

```{r}
glimpse(visitors)
```

```{r}
typeof(visitors$attraction)
```

### Q3. Which attraction had the most number of visitors in 2022?

```{r}
visitors %>% arrange(desc(n_2022))
```

The Crown Estate, Windsor Great Park

#### c. What are the top 10 most visited attractions in 2021?

```{r}
visitors %>% arrange(desc(n_2021))
```

1. The Crown Estate, Windsor Great Park
2. Royal Botanic Gardens Kew
3. Natural History Museum (South Kensington)
4. RHS Garden Wisley
5. The British Museum
6. Tate Modern
7. Somerset House
8. Science Museum
9. Jeskyns Community Woodland
10. V&A South Kensington

### Q4. What is the admission charge for the National Museum of Scotland?

```{r}
visitors %>% filter(attraction == "National Museum of Scotland")
```

No admission charge

#### d. Which attraction had exactly 565,772 visitors in 2022?

```{r}
visitors %>% filter(n_2022 == 565772)
```

Knowsley Safari and Knowsley Hall

#### e. How many attractions had more than 1 million visitors in 2022?

```{r}
visitors %>% filter(n_2022 >= 1000000) %>%
  count()
```

22

### Q5. How many outside attractions are there in the Yorkshire and the Humber region that gives members free admission, which had more than 100,000 visitors in 2022?

```{r}
nrow(visitors %>%
  filter(
    setting == "O",
    region == "Yorkshire and the Humber",
    admission == "Members",
    n_2022 >= 100000
  ))
```

3

#### f. How many attractions had between 50,000 and 100,0000 visitors in 2022?

```{r}

```

#### g. How many regions have more than 50 tourist attractions in the data set?

```{r}

```

### Q6. What are the mean and median visitor numbers in 2022 across all attractions?

```{r}
visitors %>%
  summarise(
    mean_2022 = mean(n_2022),
    med_2022 = median(n_2022)
  )
```

#### h. Perform the same calculation for the 2021 admissions data.

```{r}
visitors %>%
  summarise(
    mean_2021 = mean(n_2021),
    med_2021 = median(n_2021)
  )
```

#### i. What does NA stand for and why are you getting this as your answer to the previous question?

Values cannot be found/not applicable

Some attractions may not have been open in 2021 (hence, no value)

#### j. Edit your code from exercise h so that it computes the summary statistics where data is available.

```{r}

```

### Q7. Which setting (inside, outside or mixed) has the largest mean visitor numbers in 2022?

```{r}
visitors %>%
  group_by(setting) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_2022 = mean(n_2022),
    med_2022 = median(n_2022)
  )
```

Inside

#### k.

### Q8. What is the interquartile range for each of the four nations of the four nations of the UK?

```{r}
#English regions into a nation variable
visitors_with_nations <- visitors %>%
  mutate(
    nation = case_when(
  region == "Northern Ireland" ~ "Northern Ireland",
  region == "Scotland" ~ "Scotland",
  region == "Wales" ~ "Wales",
  TRUE ~ "England"
))
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
